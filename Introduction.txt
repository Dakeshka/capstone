Introduction

This project is going to use Jupyter Notebook to analyze GEO data of Sydney Metro suburbs.

As part of the Data Science assignment, it'll use public available data as well as various
libraries and tools. The Foursquare location data will be used during the excercise.

Business Problem

Often people feel lost when trying to make decision based on location. The data is either not available
or not well organized. This project is trying to resolve this problem by analyzing various related data.

Based on the detail analysis, interesting party may make business decision with more information and
confidence. For example, a potential property investor may purchase a property in suburbs which have
more desired facilities.  A small business may open a coffee shop in a suburb to maximize the profit.
